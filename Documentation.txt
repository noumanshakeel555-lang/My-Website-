Restaurant Ordering System - Documentation
===============================

This program is a simple console-based restaurant order management system written in C++.
It allows a user to view a menu, place orders, calculate bills with discounts and tax,
and decide if they want to order again.

---------------------------------
Program Overview
---------------------------------
The system includes:
- A menu with a list of food items, their prices, and quantities available.
- Functions to display the menu, take orders, calculate the total bill,
  show an order summary, and repeat the process if desired.
- Discounts and tax applied to the final bill.

---------------------------------
Global Data
---------------------------------
1. `items[]`: List of available food items.
2. `price[]`: Corresponding prices of each item.
3. `qua[]`: Quantity available in stock for each item.

These arrays are accessed across multiple functions for item validation, billing,
and stock management.

---------------------------------
Functions and Their Roles
---------------------------------

1. **display_menu()**
   - Prints a formatted menu of available items.
   - Shows each item’s name, price, and stock count.
   - Displays discount and tax information.
   - Marks the start of the ordering process.

2. **bill_calculator(string ordered_item, int quantity)**
   - Searches for the ordered item in the menu.
   - Checks if enough stock is available.
   - If available, calculates the cost by multiplying quantity × price.
   - Deducts the ordered quantity from stock.
   - If the item isn’t found or stock is insufficient, it informs the user and restarts the order.

3. **display_bill(float bill)**
   - Displays the raw bill amount.
   - Applies a 5% discount if the bill exceeds 5000.
   - Applies a 10% discount if the bill exceeds 10000.
   - Adds 8% tax to the total bill.
   - Shows the detailed breakdown of the bill including tax and discount.
   - Returns the final payable amount.

4. **show_order_summary(vector<string> ordered_items, vector<int> quantities)**
   - Displays all items that were ordered with their respective quantities.
   - Helps the user review their complete order before payment.

5. **taking_order()**
   - Handles the full process of taking user input for orders.
   - Prompts the user to enter item names and quantities.
   - Uses `bill_calculator()` to compute the total bill.
   - Supports adding multiple items in a single order.
   - Lets the user restart the order (`r`) or complete it (`c`).
   - After completion, displays the bill and order summary.

6. **repeat_order()**
   - Asks if the customer wants to place another order.
   - If yes, the menu is shown again and the ordering process restarts.
   - If no, the program thanks the user and ends.

7. **main()**
   - The entry point of the program.
   - Calls `display_menu()`, then `taking_order()`, and finally `repeat_order()`.
   - Ensures the entire program flow runs in proper order.

---------------------------------
Program Workflow
---------------------------------

1. **Start Program**
   - `main()` runs automatically.
   - The menu is displayed using `display_menu()`.

2. **Order Taking**
   - The user is prompted to enter item names and quantities in `taking_order()`.
   - Each valid entry updates the bill via `bill_calculator()`.

3. **Bill Calculation**
   - Once the user finishes ordering, `display_bill()` is called to show discounts, tax, and total amount.

4. **Order Summary**
   - The final list of ordered items and their quantities is shown using `show_order_summary()`.

5. **Repeat Option**
   - The program calls `repeat_order()` to ask if the user wants to order again.
   - If ‘y’, the process restarts. If ‘n’, the program ends with a thank-you message.

---------------------------------
Notes and Limitations
---------------------------------
- Input must match the exact item name from the menu i.e you cannot enter an invalid item name.
- The program restarts the order process if an invalid item is entered.
- Stock quantities reduce automatically after each order.
- The discount for bills above 10000 is set to 10%, and for bills between 5000 and 10000 it is set to 5%.
